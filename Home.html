										<h2><a href="#">Education</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>I'm currently a college student taking the course BS IET-GD (Game Development course) and I'm taking side jobs surrounding development to further my knowledge and experience within this industry. I also studied related topics under the STEM path in my high school which was where I found my passion for game design and development.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Experience</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>I picked up Roblox Studio around June 2024 so I have a few months of experience around the Studio. I am able to produce quality 3D models and builds for your games needs. I also make music on the side as a hobby so I can also create songs/tracks for your games, though I produce electronic music.</p>
